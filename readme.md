# My very first website

link:

I created this website at the end of my diploma of graphic design and communication, at CATC (The Commercial Arts Training College). It was previously haphazardly hosted at goDaddy when I had no idea how to manage DNS or hosting companies, I remeber being completely blasted by 2 years hosting upfront, having no idea how to setup an FTP, and all sorts of fun stuff. This website also landed me my first job, and served as a gateway to getting me into what is now my passion.
